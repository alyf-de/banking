- **Save** and you are good to go.

**The Bank and Bank Accounts will be created automatically at the end of the flow.**

> **Note:** This entire process of authentication with the Bank will be required once every quarter. More on this below

## Fetching Bank Transactions
Bank Transactions can be manually or automatically fetched/synced.

### Manually fetching/syncing transactions
Manually fetching transactions is currently only supported for one account at a time.

- Click on **Sync Transactions** in the settings page.
- Select the Bank Account whose transactions must be synced. Click on **Continue**

The transactions are enqueued to be fetched in the background. This job could be time consuming depending on the amount of transactions

### Automatic Transaction fetch/sync
By default a daily scheduled job will refresh Bank Accounts' data and fetch their transactions. This does not require any user intervention

**The transactions can be checked in the Bank Transactions List.**

> **Note:** The first bank transaction sync will consider the start date as the start of the current fiscal year

## Bank Consent

Once you finish syncing Bank and Bank Accounts by entering your bank credentials, you have essentially given the app consent (for a limited time) to access your bank accounts data.

Consent is stored in the form of a token in the Bank record. The expiry of the consent is also visible

#### What data am I consenting to share?
You will be consenting to share:
- The list of accounts (and account data) under your bank customer ID (whose credentials you entered)
- Bank Transactions and their data (reference number, account, amount, counter party, etc.) linked to the accounts above, from the start of the current fiscal year

#### How long is the consent active for?
The consent expiry is set for 90 days from the day of creation (approximately 1 quarter). Until it expires, no user intervention is required to fetch data.

#### What do I do once the consent expires?
Once the consent expires, you will have to give explicit consent again by [resyncing bank and bank accounts](#fetching-a-bank-and-bank-accounts).

#### Is this consent token safe ?
It is safely encrypted and is also exchanged with Klarna Kosma after every request that uses it.
